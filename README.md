# Chess game using graphics.h library

#### This project was developed as part of my first-year, first-semester Structured Programming Lab course. It is a console-based chess game implemented in C++, featuring basic game mechanics, turn-based player interactions, and move validation for all chess pieces. 

#### Developing the chess game required implementing game logic, user input handling, and board representation. The graphics.h library was used in the project for visual elements, and file handling in C++ to save and load game states. It also included move constraints and piece-specific movement rules to ensure accurate gameplay.

#### I worked on implementing game logic, piece movement validation, and user input handling in C++. I also contributed to graphics-based UI elements, file handling for saving and loading games, and debugging logic errors to improve game stability. This project helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and understanding of algorithmic implementation in game development.
